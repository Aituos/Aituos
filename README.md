- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aituos

I'm a fox living in Poland. :fox_face:

I find a lot of things to be interesting, so I end up jumping from one thing to another :sweat_smile:

In the past, I dabbled in C++, Python, HTML/CSS, I also used to make music, draw, grow plants... you get the idea. Out of all the things I tried, there are a few that I feel especially passionate about - graphic design, drawing and building websites with HTML/CSS.

So, that's exactly what I'm doing right now - studying HTML/CSS by building relatively simple websites. I'll most likely start introducing javascript into my studies, SASS, and then things like react js and other popular libraries and frameworks. But, one step at a time. I'm still pretty much a newbie.

My dream is to, eventually, become a front-end developer working full time or freelancing.
